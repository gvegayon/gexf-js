	* js/gexfjs.js: A bunch of changes:
		- Created a constructor GEXFjs with methods to access/edit data.
		- Language Defs as DICTIONARY.
		- config.js no longer needed.
		- Overall function now modular. Needs to be called to render 
		  the graph.
		- Support for XML passed as string. This is important for
		  rgexf (so you don't need a gexf file).
